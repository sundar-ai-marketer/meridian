## Documentation Map

*   **General Introduction & Basics:**

    *   `docs/basics/meridian-introduction.md` (Overview of Meridian as an
        open-source Bayesian MMM framework. It answers core questions about ROI,
        response curves, and budget allocation. Key features include causal
        inference focus, use of priors for expertise, control variables like
        Google Query Volume, geo-level data advantages, and reach/frequency
        support. Outlines the end-to-end workflow: pre-modeling, modeling, and
        post-modeling.)
    *   `docs/basics/glossary.md` (Defines key terms. Notable definitions
        include: Baseline (counterfactual scenario), Calibration (using
        experiments for priors), Contribution (incremental outcome %),
        Confounding vs Predictor variables, CPIK, Effect Window, Flighting
        pattern (spend allocation), Lagged effect (adstock), mROI, Saturation
        (no specific threshold), and SUTVA assumptions for non-geo hierarchies.)
    *   `docs/faqs.md` (Answers common questions. Key points: Data privacy
        (Google only sees data requested from its platform), GeoX integration,
        LightweightMMM migration data needs, GQV scope (indexed only),
        time-varying effects via data partitioning (warns against
        over-partitioning), lack of synergy support, ROI over time options, and
        strong recommendation against non-geo hierarchies. Emphasizes that
        Meridian is for causal inference, not prediction.)

*   **Data Preparation & Loading:**

    *   `docs/pre-modeling/collect-data.md` (Guides on gathering historical data
        for media, spend, controls, KPI, and population. Recommends weekly
        granularity and a minimum of 2-3 years of data. Advises limiting the
        number of media channels to ensure sufficient variation and volume,
        suggesting grouping smaller channels.)
    *   `docs/pre-modeling/amount-data-needed.md` (Explains data sufficiency
        based on 'data points per effect'. National models need more years of
        data compared to geo models. Discourages campaign-level data due to
        parameter inflation and risk of losing Adstock memory. Recommends
        tighter, regularizing priors when data is insufficient in geo models.)
    *   `docs/advanced-modeling/input-data.md` (Defines mathematical notation
        and dimensions for model inputs (KPI, controls, media, etc.). Explains

        population scaling and standardization to mean zero and standard
        deviation one.)

        `DataFrameInputDataBuilder`.)
    *   `docs/user-guide/load-geo-data-with-rf.md` (Detailed guide with code
        examples for loading geo-level data with reach and frequency, extending
        the standard loading to include reach, frequency, and RF spend.)
    *   `docs/user-guide/load-national-data.md` (Detailed guide with code
        examples for loading national-level data, similar to geo-level loading
        but removing the geographic dimension.)
    *   `docs/user-guide/load-geo-data-with-organic-and-non-media.md` (Detailed
        guide with code examples for loading geo-level data that includes
        organic media (no cost) and non-media treatments (e.g., promotions).)
