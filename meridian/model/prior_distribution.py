class PriorDistribution:
  """Contains prior distributions for each model parameter.

  PriorDistribution is a utility class for Meridian. The required shapes of the
  arguments to `PriorDistribution` depend on the modeling options and data
  shapes passed to Meridian. For example, `ec_m` is a parameter that represents
  the half-saturation for each media channel. The `ec_m` argument must have
  either `batch_shape=[]` or `batch_shape` equal to the number of media
  channels. In the case of the former, each media channel gets the same prior.

  An error is raised upon Meridian construction if any prior distribution
  has a shape that cannot be broadcast to the shape designated by the model
  specification.

  The parameter batch shapes are as follows:

  (σ) `n_geos` if `unique_sigma_for_each_geo`, otherwise this is `1`

  Attributes:
    knot_values: Prior distribution on knots for time effects. Default
      distribution is `Normal(0.0, 5.0)`.
    tau_g_excl_baseline: Prior distribution on geo effects, which represent the
      average KPI of each geo relative to the baseline geo. This parameter is
      broadcast to a vector of length `n_geos - 1`, preserving the geo order and
      excluding the `baseline_geo`. After sampling, `Meridian.inference_data`
      includes a modified version of this parameter called `tau_g`, which has
      length `n_geos` and contains a zero in the position corresponding to
      `baseline_geo`. Meridian ignores this distribution if `n_geos = 1`.
      Default distribution is `Normal(0.0, 5.0)`.
    beta_m: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical distribution
      of geo-level media effects for impression media channels (`beta_gm`). When
      `media_effects_dist` is set to `'normal'`, it is the hierarchical mean.
      When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'log_normal'`, it is the hierarchical
      parameter for the mean of the underlying, log-transformed, `Normal`
      distribution. Meridian ignores this distribution if
      `paid_media_prior_type` is `'roi'` or `'mroi'`, and uses the `roi_m` or
      `mroi_m` prior instead. Default distribution is `HalfNormal(5.0)`.
    beta_rf: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical distribution
      of geo-level media effects for reach and frequency media channels
      (`beta_grf`). When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'normal'`, it is the
      hierarchical mean. When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'log_normal'`, it
      is the hierarchical parameter for the mean of the underlying,
      log-transformed, `Normal` distribution. Meridian ignores this distribution
      if `paid_media_prior_type` is `'roi'` or `'mroi'`, and uses the `roi_m` or
      `mroi_rf` prior instead. Default distribution is `HalfNormal(5.0)`.
    beta_om: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical distribution
      of geo-level media effects for organic media channels (`beta_gom`). When
      `media_effects_dist` is set to `'normal'`, it is the hierarchical mean.
      When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'log_normal'`, it is the hierarchical
      parameter for the mean of the underlying, log-transformed, `Normal`
      distribution. Default distribution is `HalfNormal(5.0)`.
    beta_orf: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical
      distribution of geo-level media effects for organic reach and frequency
      media channels (`beta_gorf`). When `media_effects_dist` is set to
      `'normal'`, it is the hierarchical mean. When `media_effects_dist` is set
      to `'log_normal'`, it is the hierarchical parameter for the mean of the
      underlying, log-transformed, `Normal` distribution. Default distribution
      is `HalfNormal(5.0)`.
    eta_m: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical distribution
      of geo-level media effects for impression media channels (`beta_gm`). When
      `media_effects_dist` is set to `'normal'`, it is the hierarchical standard
      deviation. When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'log_normal'` it is the
      hierarchical parameter for the standard deviation of the underlying,
      log-transformed, `Normal` distribution. Default distribution is
      `HalfNormal(1.0)`.
    eta_rf: Prior distribution on a parameter for the hierarchical distribution
      of geo-level media effects for RF media channels (`beta_grf`). When
      `media_effects_dist` is set to `'normal'`, it is the hierarchical standard
      deviation. When `media_effects_dist` is set to `'log_normal'` it is the
      hierarchical parameter for the standard deviation of the underlying,
      log-transformed, `Normal` distribution. Default distribution is
      `HalfNormal(1.0)`.

      of geo-level media effects for organic RF media channels (`beta_gorf`).

      is the hierarchical parameter for the standard deviation of the
      underlying, log-transformed, `Normal` distribution. Default distribution
      is `HalfNormal(1.0)`.
    gamma_c: Prior distribution on the hierarchical mean of `gamma_gc` which is
      the coefficient on control `c` for geo `g`. Hierarchy is defined over
      geos. Default distribution is `Normal(0.0, 5.0)`.
    gamma_n: Prior distribution on the hierarchical mean of `gamma_gn` which is
      the coefficient on non-media channel `n` for geo `g`. Hierarchy is defined
      over geos. Default distribution is `Normal(0.0, 5.0)`.
    xi_c: Prior distribution on the hierarchical standard deviation of

      input. Default distribution is `Uniform(0.0, 1.0)`.
    ec_m: Prior distribution on the `half-saturation` Hill parameter for media
      input. Default distribution is `TruncatedNormal(0.8, 0.8, 0.1, 10)`.
    ec_rf: Prior distribution on the `half-saturation` Hill parameter for RF
      input. Default distribution is `TransformedDistribution(LogNormal(0.7,
      0.4), Shift(0.1))`.
    ec_om: Prior distribution on the `half-saturation` Hill parameter for
      organic media input. Default distribution is `TruncatedNormal(0.8, 0.8,
      0.1, 10)`.
    ec_orf: Prior distribution on the `half-saturation` Hill parameter for
      organic RF input. Default distribution is `TransformedDistribution(
      LogNormal(0.7, 0.4), Shift(0.1))`.
    slope_m: Prior distribution on the `slope` Hill parameter for media input.
      Default distribution is `Deterministic(1.0)`.
    slope_rf: Prior distribution on the `slope` Hill parameter for RF input.
      Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.7, 0.4)`.
    slope_om: Prior distribution on the `slope` Hill parameter for organic media
      input. Default distribution is `Deterministic(1.0)`.
    slope_orf: Prior distribution on the `slope` Hill parameter for organic RF
      input. Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.7, 0.4)`.
    sigma: Prior distribution on the standard deviation of noise. Default
      distribution is `HalfNormal(5.0)`.
    roi_m: Prior distribution on the ROI of each media channel. This parameter
      is only used when `paid_media_prior_type` is `'roi'`, in which case
      `beta_m` is calculated as a deterministic function of `roi_m`, `alpha_m`,
      `ec_m`, `slope_m`, and the spend associated with each media channel.
      Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.2, 0.9)`. When `kpi_type` is
      `'non_revenue'` and `revenue_per_kpi` is not provided, ROI is interpreted
      as incremental KPI units per monetary unit spent. In this case, the
      default value for `roi_m` and `roi_rf` will be ignored and a common ROI
      prior will be assigned to all channels to achieve a target mean and
      standard deviation on the total media contribution.
    roi_rf: Prior distribution on the ROI of each Reach & Frequency channel.
      This parameter is only used when `paid_media_prior_type` is `'roi'`, in
      which case `beta_rf` is calculated as a deterministic function of
      `roi_rf`, `alpha_rf`, `ec_rf`, `slope_rf`, and the spend associated with
      each RF channel. Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.2, 0.9)`. When
      `kpi_type` is `'non_revenue'` and `revenue_per_kpi` is not provided, ROI
      is interpreted as incremental KPI units per monetary unit spent. In this
      case, the default value for `roi_m` and `roi_rf` will be ignored and a
      common ROI prior will be assigned to all channels to achieve a target mean
      and standard deviation on the total media contribution.
    mroi_m: Prior distribution on the mROI of each media channel. This parameter
      is only used when `paid_media_prior_type` is `'mroi'`, in which case
      `beta_m` is calculated as a deterministic function of `mroi_m`, `alpha_m`,
      `ec_m`, `slope_m`, and the spend associated with each media channel.
      Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.0, 0.5)`. When `kpi_type` is
      `'non_revenue'` and `revenue_per_kpi` is not provided, mROI is interpreted
      as the marginal incremental KPI units per monetary unit spent. In this
      case, a default distribution is not provided, so the user must specify it.
    mroi_rf: Prior distribution on the mROI of each Reach & Frequency channel.
      This parameter is only used when `paid_media_prior_type` is `'mroi'`, in
      which case `beta_rf` is calculated as a deterministic function of
      `mroi_rf`, `alpha_rf`, `ec_rf`, `slope_rf`, and the spend associated with
      each media channel. Default distribution is `LogNormal(0.0, 0.5)`. When
      `kpi_type` is `'non_revenue'` and `revenue_per_kpi` is not provided, mROI
      is interpreted as the marginal incremental KPI units per monetary unit
      spent. In this case, a default distribution is not provided, so the user
      must specify it.
    contribution_m: Prior distribution on the contribution of each media channel
      as a percentage of total outcome. This parameter is only used when
      `paid_media_prior_type` is `'contribution'`, in which case `beta_m` is
      calculated as a deterministic function of `contribution_m`, `alpha_m`,
      `ec_m`, `slope_m`, and the total outcome. Default distribution is
      `Beta(1.0, 99.0)`.
    contribution_rf: Prior distribution on the contribution of each Reach &
      Frequency channel as a percentage of total outcome. This parameter is only
      used when `paid_media_prior_type` is `'contribution'`, in which case
      `beta_rf` is calculated as a deterministic function of `contribution_rf`,
      `alpha_rf`, `ec_rf`, `slope_rf`, and the total outcome. Default
      distribution is `Beta(1.0, 99.0)`.
    contribution_om: Prior distribution on the contribution of each organic
      media channel as a percentage of total outcome. This parameter is only
      used when `organic_media_prior_type` is `'contribution'`, in which case
      `beta_om` is calculated as a deterministic function of `contribution_om`,
      `alpha_om`, `ec_om`, `slope_om`, and the total outcome. Default
      distribution is `Beta(1.0, 99.0)`.
    contribution_orf: Prior distribution on the contribution of each organic
      Reach & Frequency channel as a percentage of total outcome. This parameter
      is only used when `organic_media_prior_type` is `'contribution'`, in which
      case `beta_orf` is calculated as a deterministic function of
      `contribution_orf`, `alpha_orf`, `ec_orf`, `slope_orf`, and the total
      outcome. Default distribution is `Beta(1.0, 99.0)`.
    contribution_n: Prior distribution on the contribution of each non-media
      treatment channel as a percentage of total outcome. This parameter is only
      used when `non_media_treatment_prior_type` is `'contribution'`, in which
      case `gamma_n` is calculated as a deterministic function of
      `contribution_n` and the total outcome. Default distribution is
      `TruncatedNormal(0.0, 0.1, -1.0, 1.0)`.

  This class is useful when one wants to define a joint distribution for a

  one element is Uniform and the second is triangular:

  ```python
  distributions = [

      tfp.distributions.Triangular(0.0, 1.0, 0.5)
      ]
  distribution = IndependentMultivariateDistribution(distributions)

  It is also possible to define a distribution where multiple elements come
  from the same distribution family. For example, to define a distribution where
  the three elements are LogNormal(0.2, 0.9), LogNormal(0, 0.5) and
  Gamma(2, 2):

  ```python
  distributions = [

    mass_percent: Float or array-like denoting the probability mass. Values must
      be between 0 and 1 (exclusive). Default: 0.95.
